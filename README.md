# Weather-App

This project is a JavaScript application that displays weather information for a specific location. The user can search for a city, and the application will retrieve the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and other relevant details. The app also displays an icon that reflects the current weather conditions.

**Installation:** To use this application, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. You will also need to obtain an API key from a weather data provider such as weatherapi.

**Usage:** To use the Weather-App, simply enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the search bar and click the "Get Weather" button. The app will retrieve the current weather conditions and display them on the screen.

**Project Structure:** The project consists of a single HTML file (index.html), a CSS file (style.css), and a JavaScript file (script.js). The HTML file provides the structure for the application, while the CSS file handles the styling of the interface. The JavaScript file is responsible for fetching weather data from the weather data provider API and displaying it on the screen.
